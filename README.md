# Tower of Hanoi - Java Implementation

## Overview
This is a Java implementation of the **Tower of Hanoi** problem. The Tower of Hanoi is a classic puzzle that involves moving a series of disks from one peg to another, subject to the following rules:
1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack.
3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

This project demonstrates how to solve the puzzle using recursion and can be customized for different numbers of disks.

## Features
- Solves the Tower of Hanoi problem recursively.
- Customizable number of disks.
- Output showing each move in the process of solving the puzzle.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AshMeoww/tower-of-hanoi-java.git

2. Navigate to project directory:
   ```bash
   cd tower-of-hanoi-java
  
4. Compile and run the Java program:
   ```bash
    java TowerOfHanoi

Example Output:
The program will show the steps required to solve the Tower of Hanoi for the number of disks you entered. For example, with 3 disks, the output would be:
Move disk 1 from A to C
Move disk 2 from A to B
Move disk 1 from C to B
Move disk 3 from A to C
Move disk 1 from B to A
Move disk 2 from B to C
Move disk 1 from A to C
